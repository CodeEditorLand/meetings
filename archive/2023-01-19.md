-   [x] Jonas & Lorenzo: Tauri Survey Reflections
    -   HTTPS://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRVfQlRNeURfVtza6KurprVEYRh8nTmYaySmqz6_K4Q/edit#gid=105441987
-   [x] How to open our meetings to working group or even community.

### Notes

-   Stable version freeze incoming. Future tao/wry release will be merged into
    next branch instead.
-   DevServer on Android requires a proxy which is served through `https` and
    won't work with `ws` which most HMR servers use to serve its changes. Other
    platforms don't have this restriction (iOS to be confirmed).

### Action Items

-   [ ] Long term support for release.
