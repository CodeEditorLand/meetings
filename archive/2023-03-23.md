# Tauri Devs Bi-Weekly Meeting Notes

## Mar 23, 2023

### Agenda

-   Lucas: Tauri v2.0.0-alpha.4
    -   HTTPS://tauri.app/blog/2023/03/20/tauri-2-0-0-alpha-4/
    -   "HTTP Client Breaking Change"
    -   "Native Mobile Functionality for Tauri Plugins"
    -   RFC coming soon
-   Yuwei:
    [`webkit2gtk v2.40`](HTTPS://webkitgtk.org/2023/03/17/webkitgtk2.40.0-released.html)
    released woop woop!
    -   IPC improvement research started again:
        HTTPS://github.com/tauri-apps/wry/issues/454
-   Daniel: Preparing for the 2.0 Audit
    -   [`1.0 was externally audited by Radically Open Security`](HTTPS://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/audits)
    -   Minor releases were/are internally audited (1.2 was, 1.3, etc.)
    -   Expecting the same internal audit to happen for 2.0
    -   Internally audit 2.0 during alpha, once audited to satisfaction then
        release as beta
    -   Then audited externally and issues resolved to satisfaction we move from
        beta to RCs
-   Lorenzo: Semver Syncing
    -   HTTPS://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6506
    -   How would releasing minor versions for plugins look like? Would that
        also bump majors?
    -   Differences between cargo semver and node semver?
    -   What's our definition of a major/minor/patch?
    -   Some sort of tooling to help "check" that versions across the ecosystem
        are compatible (plugins, core, Rust side, Node side, etc.)?
    -   Can `tauri info` detect plugin version incompatibility and notify you
        there?
-   Lucas(?) & Fabian(?): Minor 1.x versions before 2.0
    -   tao / wry have branches for the version tauri 1.x needs
    -   Want to get new features out to the community, less time without updates
    -   Up until now we've said "freeze at 1.3 to focus on 2.0", but is that the
        right decision?
    -   Propose have the "core" people working on `next` to continue, but have a
        parallel focus to backport some features to 1.x
    -   Could also make the internal audit for 2.0 easier as some features will
        be audited
    -   Possibly make 1.x releases that bring in non-breaking refactoring
        changes to keep the codebase closer to 2.0
-   Lorenzo: `tauri add` CLI command feature request
    -   HTTPS://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6505
    -   `tauri plugin add|update|remove` proposed by Daniel?
    -   Updating the Rust code could be a challenge
-   Lorenzo & Simon: "Officially Maintained" Framework Support
    -   Discord Thread:
        HTTPS://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1088462494143619094
    -   With the docs & CTA we need to limit ourselves to a set of "officially
        maintained" frameworks for sanity's sake
    -   We talked about this being Svelte, React, Solid, Vue, and Angular for
        Node (based off the latest
        [`State of JS's frontend framework`](HTTPS://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/)
        usage, Solid slipping in because it's at the top of retention)
    -   Where do things like Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, etc. fit in here?
    -   Astro has a concept of "Official" vs. "Community" maintained recipes
        HTTPS://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/. We could implement this in the
        docs and CTA for "official" vs "community" maintained configurations
    -   Possible confusion between what Tauri supports vs. what templates we
        maintain
    -   Look at the Rust Tier system for inspo. They all have some official
        support (someone "sponsors" it)
        -   Tier 1 could have integration tests
        -   Tier 2 doesn't have integration tests
    -   Mention / push `tauri init` more, people don't always know it exists.
    -   With CTA 2 it was a minimal set of templates
        -   Over time we got more submitted from the community but we had to
            take on the maintenance ourselves (AKA Amr)
        -   the new github code search could also be a viable way for us to
            discover community templates in the wild and try and contribute our
            guidelines ("mention how to clone/create with it at the top of the
            readme")

### Chat questions

Q: will 1.3 be released before or alongside 2.0? A: Before.

### Action Items

-   Next WG call will be focused specifically on release schedules
