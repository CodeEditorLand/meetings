### Agenda

-   Mobile support updates:
    -   plugin progress
        -   mobile plugin RFC: HTTPS://github.com/tauri-apps/rfcs/pull/9
        -   API refactor RFC: HTTPS://github.com/tauri-apps/rfcs/pull/10
    -   tauri mobile cli overview
        -   Looking for what's still missing in the CLI. For now, we are missing
            `cargo-mobile doctor`. This is basically check command and can add
            to tauri-cli, for example, `cargo ios check` and
            `cargo android check`.
    -   beta
        -   We will need to sepcify Android/iOS version, as well as for it's
            SDK.

        -   It can go wrong pretty fast. If we need this, it's probably going to
            be alternative on Linux only to cover missing features in WebkitGTK.
        -   We'll only consider flatpak and make this as a flatpak extension.
            Consider an extension is a common practice for flatpak and it won't
            make every app static link into CEF.
