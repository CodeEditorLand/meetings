# Tauri Devs Bi-Weekly Meeting Notes

## May 19, 2023

### Agenda

-   Looking for Ops & Dev Domain Leads
    -   General Governance model update (@beanow)
        -   HTTPS://hackmd.io/@Beanow/BJC5NXidj/%2Fmr5_odUoT-2BVBf9klBFzA
    -   Looking for Governance, Community and Board Director candidates
        (elections soon).
        -   Feel free to apply and/or nominate ahead of time :]
        -   Contact the Board for this. (@board / board@tauri.app)
-   Tauri v2.0.0-alpha.9 released
-   Switching default branch on main repo
-   Scope of 2.0 - Keeping it minimal
    -   Experimental Mobile support.
        -   Features except drawing something on your phone might missing. The
            native APIs you want to use might missing. (We have plugins to allow
            users to do it themselves but I don't expect most users will do so.)
        -   Too much workload and too few people to deliver everything all at
            once.
        -   Mobile Env setup is a challenge. It stays the same if you want to
            use Tauri.
    -   Plugin workspace.

## Action Items
